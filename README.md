# MagicFrameChanger
A simple tool in Python+Qt for quickly changing image files around for my OBS overlay

Requires:

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySideDownloads)

Simple usage:

Edit the frame image files located in Frames sub directory to contain your information (maintain the file names).

Update the file path and current frame name as desired in the settings panel.

Point OBS / streaming software to the current frame PNG to be displayed on your overlay.

Enjoy!
